#Information
======
This project focuses on creating a Gameboy emulator.

The emulator uses SDL for it's display and input, and is written in C++.  

The goal of this project is to create an emulator that can run games somewhat accurately, and to learn about CPU design.  

There are currently no plans to emulate sound and memory banking past the first type.    

#Current Progress
======
Finished opcode implementation. Will need to test them using Blargg's test roms.
